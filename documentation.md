# Movie Review Sentiment Analyzer - Project Documentation

## üìñ Introduction

The Movie Review Sentiment Analyzer is a web application that classifies movie reviews as positive or negative using deep learning. Built with Streamlit and TensorFlow, this tool demonstrates natural language processing (NLP) capabilities by analyzing text sentiment with an accuracy of ~86.7%.

Key objectives:
- Provide instant sentiment analysis for movie reviews
- Showcase LSTM neural networks for NLP tasks
- Offer an accessible interface for non-technical users

## üß† Methods & Architecture

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python web framework)
- **Backend**: TensorFlow/Keras (Deep learning)
- **NLP Processing**: NLTK (Text preprocessing)
- **Model Hosting**: Hugging Face Hub

### Model Architecture
1. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - HTML tag removal
   - Special character cleaning
   - Lowercase conversion
   - Stopword removal
   - Word lemmatization

2. **Neural Network**:
   ```mermaid
   graph LR
   A[Embedding Layer] --> B[LSTM Layer]
   B --> C[Batch Normalization]
   C --> D[Dense Layer]
   D --> E[Sigmoid Output]
   ```

3. **Key Parameters**:
   - Vocabulary size: 10,000 words
   - Embedding dimension: 128
   - Max sequence length: 200 tokens
   - Dropout rate: 0.3 (for regularization)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced

### 1. Deployment Issues
- **Problem**: TensorFlow 2.15.0 incompatibility with Python 3.12
- **Solution**: Upgraded to TensorFlow 2.16.1 and used CPU-only version

### 2. NLTK Data Download
- **Problem**: FileExistsError during NLTK data download
- **Solution**: Implemented existence check before download:
  ```python
  try:
      nltk.data.find('corpora/stopwords')
  except LookupError:
      nltk.download('stopwords')
  ```

### 3. Model Size Constraints
- **Problem**: Large model files (>100MB) couldn't be stored in GitHub
- **Solution**: Hosted model on Hugging Face Hub with automatic download

## üéØ Results & Performance

- **Accuracy**: 86.7% on test set
- **Inference Time**: ~0.5 seconds per review
- **Confidence Scores**: Displayed for each prediction

Example prediction:
```
Prediction: Positive
Confidence: 92.34%
```

## üí° Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Model**:
   - Experiment with BERT/GPT architectures
   - Add multi-language support

2. **Features**:
   - Batch processing for multiple reviews
   - Sentiment intensity visualization
   - User feedback mechanism to improve model

3. **Optimization**:
   - Quantize model for faster inference
   - Implement caching for frequent queries

## üèÅ Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates:
- Practical application of LSTM networks for sentiment analysis
- Effective solutions for deployment challenges
- Creation of user-friendly NLP tools

The application serves as both a functional sentiment analysis tool and an educational resource for those interested in NLP and deep learning deployment.
